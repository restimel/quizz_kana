# quizz_kana

A quizz to train on learning Kana.

It is a quite old application I wrote, but I would like to improve it again.

The quizz online: https://restimel.github.io/quizz_kana/quizz.html

## Done

* Choice between hiragana and katakana
* Timer to see on which kana user has difficulties
* Create quizz selection of some kana
* Allow to answer by keyboard
* Propose kana depending on mistake (when you make mistake on a kana they appear more often)

## TODO

* propose (in option) serie of kana instead of single kana
* propose combined kana (sha, cho ...)
* Rebuild interface
* Remember properties and configuration (when coming back to the page)
